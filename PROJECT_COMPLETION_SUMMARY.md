- Core Transformer blocks process inputs correctly
- Tokenizers encode/decode text accurately
- Training loops execute without errors
- Advanced components (MoE, RLHF, etc.) function as expected
- Educational materials are properly structured

## Conclusion

The LLM from Scratch implementation is complete and ready for use in educational settings or as a foundation for further research and development. All 60 tasks from the original implementation plan have been successfully completed.
