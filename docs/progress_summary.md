## Key Features Implemented

1. **Core Transformer Components**:
   - Scaled dot-product attention
   - Multi-head attention mechanism
   - Transformer blocks with residual connections and LayerNorm

2. **Modern Architectural Improvements**:
   - RMSNorm as an alternative to LayerNorm
   - RoPE (Rotary Positional Embeddings) for position encoding
   - SwiGLU activation function in feed-forward networks

3. **Training Infrastructure**:
   - Byte-level tokenizer
   - Data loading and batching utilities
   - Cross-entropy loss with label shifting
   - Training loop with optimizer integration
   - Evaluation metrics (loss, perplexity, accuracy)
   - Sampling techniques for text generation

4. **Examples and Documentation**:
   - Complete example of training a tiny LLM
   - Comparison between classic and modern architectures
   - Comprehensive documentation

## Performance Notes

The modern architecture with RMSNorm, RoPE, and SwiGLU shows comparable performance to the classic Transformer architecture, with some differences in training dynamics that are expected given the architectural changes.
