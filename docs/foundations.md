# Part 0 - Foundations & Mindset

## Overview

This document covers the foundational concepts and setup required for implementing a Large Language Model from scratch using PyTorch.

## LLM Training Pipeline

The typical LLM training pipeline consists of three main stages:

1. **Pretraining** - Training on a large corpus of text data
2. **Fine-tuning** - Adapting the model to specific tasks or domains
3. **Alignment** - Aligning the model's behavior with human preferences

## Hardware & Software Environment

### Hardware Requirements

- GPU with CUDA support (recommended minimum 8GB VRAM)
- Sufficient RAM (16GB+ recommended)
- Storage space for datasets and model checkpoints

### Software Stack

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development
- Profiling tools (PyTorch Profiler)
- Visualization tools (TensorBoard, wandb)

## Mixed Precision Training

Mixed precision training uses both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point types to reduce memory usage and increase training speed while maintaining model accuracy.

## Profiling Tools

Profiling is essential for identifying performance bottlenecks in model training and inference:

- PyTorch Profiler for detailed performance analysis
- Memory tracking tools for monitoring GPU memory usage
- Timing utilities for measuring execution time of operations

## Best Practices

1. Always verify your environment setup before beginning implementation
2. Use version control (Git) to track changes
3. Document your progress and findings
4. Test components individually before integrating them
5. Profile performance regularly to identify optimization opportunities
