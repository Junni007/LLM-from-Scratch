# LLM from Scratch - Fully Functional Implementation

This repository contains a complete implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) built from scratch using PyTorch, following the "LLM from Scratch" curriculum with all 10 parts implemented.

## 🎉 Project Status: COMPLETE AND FUNCTIONAL 🎉

All components have been successfully implemented and validated. The project is fully functional and ready for use.

## 🚀 Quick Start with Organized Pipeline

For an easier-to-use pipeline, check out the organized structure:

```bash
# 1. Place your training data in the datasets/ directory (organized by format)
#    - datasets/text/ for plain text files
#    - datasets/json/ for JSON files
#    - datasets/csv/ for CSV files
#    - datasets/custom/ for custom formats
# 2. Run the complete pipeline
python run_llm_pipeline.py

# 3. Generate text with your trained model
python generate_text.py --prompt "The future of AI"
```

See [PIPELINE_README.md](PIPELINE_README.md) for detailed instructions.
