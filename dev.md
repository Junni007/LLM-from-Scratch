# Developer Notes

This document contains important information for developers working on this project.

## Project Overview

Implementation of a Large Language Model from scratch using PyTorch, following a 10-part curriculum that builds from basic Transformer architecture to advanced techniques like Mixture-of-Experts and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback.

## Workflow Guidelines

This project follows strict workflow guidelines to ensure code quality and maintainability:

1. **Start with understanding** - Read relevant files before making changes
2. **Plan before typing** - Create TODO lists before implementation
3. **Work in small steps** - Tackle one item at a time
4. **Keep it simple** - One change, one purpose
5. **Test thoroughly** - All changes must be tested
6. **Document everything** - Update docs as we go

## Code Standards

- Functions should have a single responsibility
- Variable and function names should be descriptive
- Code should be readable rather than clever
- All code should be properly tested
- Performance should be considered for all changes

## Temporary Components

This section will be updated as we identify temporary or experimental code that needs cleanup before production.

## Known Issues

This section will track any known issues or limitations in the current implementation.

## Bug Fixes and Workarounds

This section will document any bugs found and their solutions, as well as any workarounds implemented.
